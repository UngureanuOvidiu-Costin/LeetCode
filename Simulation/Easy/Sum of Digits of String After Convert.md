# Intuition
The problem involves transforming a string of letters into a number, and then repeatedly applying a digit-sum transformation. My initial thought was to break the problem into two main steps: converting the string into a numerical representation and then performing the required number of transformations. The key observation is that the transformation process involves summing the digits of a number, which significantly reduces its size, making repeated operations feasible.

# Approach
1. String to Number Conversion:
- First, I convert each character in the string to its corresponding position in the alphabet. For example, 'a' becomes 1, 'b' becomes 2, ..., and 'z' becomes 26. These positions are then concatenated to form a large integer represented as a string.
2. Transformation Process:
- After converting the string to its numerical representation, the next step is to repeatedly transform this number by summing its digits. This transformation is done `k` times, as specified in the problem. Each transformation reduces the number by summing its digits, effectively compressing the number into a smaller value.
3. Handling Multiple Transformations:
- The process of summing the digits is encapsulated in a helper function `transform`. This function iterates over each character of the string, converts it back to an integer, and sums these values. The result is then converted back to a string to be used in the next iteration, if necessary.
- If `k` is greater than 1, the transformation process is repeated k-1 times on the initial numerical string. The final transformation step directly produces the result as an integer.
4. Returning the Result:
- The last step involves calculating the sum of digits of the final transformed string. This sum represents the result after all transformations have been applied.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:**
    - **Conversion Step:** Converting the string s to its numerical representation takes `O(n)` time, where `n` is the length of the string. This is because we iterate over each character once.
    - **Transformation Step:** The transformation of summing digits for a number with m digits takes `O(m)` time. Since the length of the string after conversion could be up to `2 * n` (for the largest possible characters, i.e., "z"), the total time complexity for each transformation is `O(m)`. Repeating this `k` times results in a time complexity of `O(k∗m)`. But, since `m` reduces after each transformation, the overall complexity is dominated by the initial length, making the complexity approximately `O(n+k∗m)`.

- **Space complexity:**
The space complexity is `O(n)` due to the storage of the intermediate string representations and the result. The string representation of the number and the transformations both take up space proportional to `n`.

# Code
```java []
class Solution {
    public int getLucky(String s, int k) {
        String transformed = "";
        int i;

        for(i = 0; i < s.length(); i = i + 1) {
            transformed = transformed + (s.charAt(i) - 'a' + 1);
        }

        if(k > 1){
            for(i = 0; i < k-1; i = i + 1) {
                transformed = transform(transformed);
            }
        }

        int result = 0;
        for(i = 0; i < transformed.length(); i = i + 1) {
            result = result + Character.getNumericValue(transformed.charAt(i));
        }

        return result;
    }

    private String transform(String s) {
        int sum = 0;
        int i;

        for(i = 0; i < s.length(); i = i + 1) {
            sum = sum + Character.getNumericValue(s.charAt(i));
        }

        return String.valueOf(sum);
    }
}
```
