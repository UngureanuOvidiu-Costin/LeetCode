# Intuition

The given code attempts to solve a problem where you need to determine how many times you can rearrange characters in string `s` to form the string `target`, respecting the frequencies of characters as given by `target`.

## Approach

We approach this problem by counting the frequency of characters in both `target` and `s`. If `s` contains enough characters to form `target` based on their frequencies, we compute how many times we can rearrange `s` to achieve this.

1. **Frequency Counting**:
   - Create a frequency map `targetCharsFrequency` for characters in `target`.
   - Create a frequency map `sCharsFrequency` for characters in `s` that are also in `target`.

2. **Validation**:
   - Iterate through each character in `targetCharsFrequency`. For each character:
     - If `sCharsFrequency` does not contain this character, return `0` because `s` cannot form `target`.
     - Otherwise, compute how many times we can form `target` using the formula: `count = min(count, sCharsFrequency.get(key) / targetCharsFrequency.get(key))`.

3. **Result**:
   - Return the computed `count` as the maximum number of times we can rearrange `s` to form `target`.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:
The time complexity is `O(n + m)`, where `n` is the length of target and `m` is the length of `s`. This is because we iterate through both strings to populate the frequency maps.

- Space complexity:
The space complexity is `O( n + m)` as well. This is due to the storage of characters and their frequencies in the two `HashMaps`.

## Code

```Java
class Solution {
    public int rearrangeCharacters(String s, String target) {
        HashMap<Character, Integer> targetCharsFrequency = new HashMap<>();
        HashMap<Character, Integer> sCharsFrequency = new HashMap<>();
        int i;

        for(i = 0; i < target.length(); i = i + 1) {
            targetCharsFrequency.put(target.charAt(i), targetCharsFrequency.getOrDefault(target.charAt(i), 0) + 1);
        }

        for(i = 0; i < s.length(); i = i + 1) {
            if(targetCharsFrequency.containsKey(s.charAt(i))){
                sCharsFrequency.put(s.charAt(i), sCharsFrequency.getOrDefault(s.charAt(i), 0) + 1);
            }
        }

        int result = 101;
        for(Character key: targetCharsFrequency.keySet()) {
            if(!sCharsFrequency.containsKey(key)) {
                return 0;
            } else {
                result = Math.min(result, sCharsFrequency.get(key) / targetCharsFrequency.get(key));
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
