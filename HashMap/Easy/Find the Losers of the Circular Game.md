# Intuition

The problem is about simulating a circular game where players are eliminated in a cyclic manner with an increasing step size. By keeping track of eliminated players using a boolean array, we can determine which players remain at the end.

## Approach

1. **Initialize Players**:
   - Use a boolean array `players` of size `n` to track whether a player is eliminated (`true`) or not (`false`).
   - Initialize `currentK` to `k` and the current index `i` to `0`.

2. **Simulate Elimination**:
   - While loop to simulate the elimination process:
     - If the current player `i` is already eliminated, break the loop.
     - Mark the current player `i` as eliminated.
     - Move to the next player by updating `i` to `(i + currentK) % n`.
     - Increase `currentK` by `k` for the next elimination step.

3. **Determine Losers**:
   - Create an `ArrayList` to store the indices of players who were never eliminated.
   - Iterate through the `players` array, adding the 1-based index of players who are still in the game to the `ArrayList`.

4. **Convert to Array**:
   - Convert the `ArrayList` to an `int[]` array to meet the return type requirement.

5. **Return Result**:
   - Return the array of players who were never eliminated.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of players. The while loop and subsequent for loop each iterate at most `n` times.

- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of players. This space is used by the boolean array and the `ArrayList`.

## Code

```Java
class Solution {
     public int[] circularGameLosers(int n, int k) {
        boolean[] players = new boolean[n];
        int currentK = k;
        int i = 0;

        while (true) {
            if (players[i]) {
                break;
            }
            players[i] = true;
            i = (i + currentK) % n;
            currentK += k;
        }

        ArrayList<Integer> losers = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (!players[j]) {
                losers.add(j + 1);
            }
        }

        int[] result = new int[losers.size()];
        for (int j = 0; j < losers.size(); j++) {
            result[j] = losers.get(j);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
