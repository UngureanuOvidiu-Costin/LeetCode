# Intuition

The problem is to count the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that the sum of `hours[i]` and `hours[j]` is a multiple of 24. This can be approached using a brute-force method where we check all possible pairs.

## Approach

1. **Brute Force:** Use nested loops to iterate through all possible pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j`.
2. **Condition Check:** For each pair `(i, j)`, check if `(hours[i] + hours[j]) % 24 == 0`.
3. **Count Pairs:** Increment a counter for each pair that satisfies the condition.
4. **Return Result:** Return the counter as the final result.

## Complexity

- Time complexity: O(N^2)
**Nested Loops:** The outer loop runs n times, and the inner loop runs n-1, n-2, ..., 1 times, resulting in `O(n^2)` time complexity.
**Condition Check:** The condition check inside the inner loop is `O(1)`.

- Space complexity: O(1)
**Auxiliary Space:** Only a few integer variables (`counter, i, j, n`) are used, which is `O(1)` space.

## Code

```Java
class Solution {
    public int countCompleteDayPairs(int[] hours) {
        int counter = 0;
        int i, j;

        for(i = 0; i < hours.length; i = i + 1) {
            for(j = i + 1; j < hours.length; j = j + 1) {
                if((hours[i] + hours[j]) % 24 == 0) {
                    counter++;
                }
            }
        }
        return counter;
    }
}
```
