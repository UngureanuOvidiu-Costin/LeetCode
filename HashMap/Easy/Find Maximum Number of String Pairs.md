# Intuition

The problem involves identifying pairs of strings where one string is the reverse of the other. Using a HashSet allows efficient checking and storing of strings and their reverses.

## Approach

1. **Initialize Data Structures**:
   - Use a `HashSet` to store the strings that have not yet found their reverse pair.
   - Initialize a counter `pairs` to keep track of the number of reverse pairs found.

2. **Process Each String**:
   - Iterate through the `words` array.
   - For each word, compute its reverse using `StringBuilder`.
   - Check if the reversed string is already in the `HashSet`:
     - If it is, increment the `pairs` counter and remove the reversed string from the `HashSet`.
     - If it is not, add the original string to the `HashSet`.

3. **Return Result**:
   - Return the counter `pairs` which contains the maximum number of reverse pairs found.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where `n` is the number of strings and `m` is the average length of the strings. This includes the time to reverse each string and check/set operations in the `HashSet`.

- **Space Complexity**: O(n * m), where `n` is the number of strings and `m` is the average length of the strings. This space is used by the `HashSet`.

## Code

```Java
class Solution {
    public int maximumNumberOfStringPairs(String[] words) {
        HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        int pairs = 0;

        for (String word : words) {
            String reversed = new StringBuilder(word).reverse().toString();
            if (set.contains(reversed)) {
                pairs++;
                set.remove(reversed);
            } else {
                set.add(word);
            }
        }

        return pairs;
    }
}
```
