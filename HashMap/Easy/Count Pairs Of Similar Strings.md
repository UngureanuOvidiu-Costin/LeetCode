# Intuition

The problem requires finding the number of pairs of strings that contain the same set of characters. Using sets and a frequency map helps efficiently identify and count such pairs.

## Approach

1. **Build Frequency Map**:
   - Use a `HashMap` called `frequencyMap` to store the frequency of each unique set of characters from the strings in `words`.
   - For each word in `words`:
     - Convert the word to a set of characters.
     - Update the frequency map with the set of characters.

2. **Count Similar Pairs**:
   - Initialize a counter `similarPairsCount` to zero.
   - For each entry in the `frequencyMap`:
     - If the frequency (count) of a set is greater than 1, calculate the number of pairs that can be formed from this count using the combination formula `C(n, 2) = n * (n - 1) / 2`.
     - Add the calculated number of pairs to `similarPairsCount`.

3. **Return**:
   - Return `similarPairsCount`, which represents the total number of similar pairs.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where n is the number of strings in the array `words` and m is the average length of the strings. This includes the time to build the character sets and update the frequency map.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * k), where n is the number of unique character sets and k is the average size of the sets. This space is used by the `HashMap` and the character sets.

## Code

```Java
class Solution {
    public int similarPairs(String[] words) {
        Map<Set<Character>, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (String word : words) {
            Set<Character> charSet = new HashSet<>();
            for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
                charSet.add(c);
            }
            
            frequencyMap.put(charSet, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(charSet, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        int similarPairsCount = 0;
        
        for (int count : frequencyMap.values()) {
            if (count > 1) {
                similarPairsCount += (count * (count - 1)) / 2;
            }
        }
        
        return similarPairsCount;
    }
}
```
