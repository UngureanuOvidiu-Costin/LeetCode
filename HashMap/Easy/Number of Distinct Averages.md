# Intuition

The problem requires finding the number of distinct averages that can be formed by selecting any two different elements from the array `nums`.

## Approach

1. **Sort the Array**:
   - Sort the array `nums`. Sorting helps in systematically calculating distinct pairs and their averages.

2. **Calculate Averages**:
   - Use a `HashSet` called `averages` to store unique averages.
   - Iterate through the first half of the sorted array (`nums.length / 2`):
     - For each pair of elements `(nums[i], nums[nums.length - i - 1])`, calculate their sum.
     - Add the calculated sum to the `averages` set.

3. **Count Distinct Averages**:
   - Return the size of the `averages` set, which represents the number of distinct averages.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * log n)`, where n is the length of the array `nums`. This is due to the sorting step.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. This space is used by the `HashSet` to store unique averages.

## Code

```Java
class Solution {
    public int distinctAverages(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> averages = new HashSet<>();
        int i;

        Arrays.sort(nums);

        for(i = 0; i <= nums.length / 2; i = i + 1) {
            averages.add((nums[i] + nums[nums.length - i - 1]));
        }

        return averages.size();
    }
}
```
