# Intuition

The problem requires determining the maximum count of the most frequently incremented cell in an `m x n` matrix after a series of operations. Each operation increases the values in a submatrix starting from the top-left corner to a given coordinate. The cell with the highest count will be within the smallest submatrix defined by the operations.

## Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Define `minX` and `minY` to track the minimum row and column bounds respectively, initialized to the maximum possible integer value.

2. **Edge Case**:
   - If there are no operations, the entire matrix remains unchanged, and the count of the most frequent value (which is `0`) is `m * n`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Bounds**:
   - Iterate through each operation and update `minX` and `minY` to find the smallest submatrix that gets incremented by all operations.

4. **Calculate Result**:
   - The maximum count of the most frequently incremented cell will be within the area defined by `minX * minY`.

## Complexity

- **Time complexity**: `O(k)`, where k is the number of operations. We iterate through each operation once.

- **Space complexity**: `O(1)`, as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

## Code

```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxCount(int m, int n, int[][] ops) {
        int minX = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int minY = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int i;

        if(ops.length == 0) {
            return m * n;
        }

        for(i = 0; i < ops.length; i = i + 1) {
            minX = Math.min(ops[i][0], minX);
            minY = Math.min(ops[i][1], minY);
        }

        return minX * minY;
    }
}
```
